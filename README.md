# Hiking Trail Recommender
Capstone Project of Lighthouse Labs consisting of web scraping hiking trail information to build a dataset on top of the Walking and Tramping routes provided by the Department of Conservation (DOC) in New Zealand. Trail information was cleaned and a recommendation system was generated based on hiking similarities.

## Project Decription
One of the biggest limitations getting into hiking is knowing which trail to pick. Often times, the common resources we have for trail information are catagorized by location-- which park is nearby and then search trails within. But if you're new to the activity or looking to branch out of your nearby park, a recommonder system that finds similar trail difficulties and popularity based on your activity level is ideal. 

## Project Setup
This github repo will contain all the information I am assembling to generate this recommendation system. 

Data: I have started with the [Walking and Tramping Routes provided by the Department of Conservation (DOC)](https://doc-deptconservation.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/e3f63067394a46238c92f9aed63ff78b), a New Zealand government agency dedicated to conserving New Zealandâ€™s natural and historic heritage. With this, I have 3000+ trail routes across NZ. I've chosen to work in NZ by personal preference as it is one of the best countries to go explore the great outdoors. I will be supplementing this information using BeautifulSoup and/or Selenium Chromedriver to scrape trail information and user review websites to generate further track information. First I will look for website resources that provide track information. Then user reviews. Time permitting, I hope to scrape an inventory of photos for these trails to offer a visual element to the recommender system(s).

Machine Learning: I intend to first generate a content-based filtering recommendation system using hike to hike similarities. This model will look at trail length, elevation, difficulties, etc. I want to integrate the ability to search through hikes where you can receive recommendations by searching a trail name, partial match, or look within the hikes for location, difficulty, length, etc. This model will be deployed to AWS with a Streamlit.io API app.

## Progress Report - Daily
The following will be updated through-out the duration of this capstone project to reflect the progress made
##### Thurs May 6, 2021
* Tasks: Find trail information to build the dataset from
* Accomplished: DOC Routes obtained. WalkingKiwi.co.nz identified as scrapable for trail information.
* Hurdles: Web scraping and parsing through the soup to get information useful to me. Need to find user information.

##### Fri May 7, 2021
* Tasks: Setup Github repo information. Scrape and transform WalkingKiwi trail information. Clean. Find user reviews of trails.
* Accomplished: Scraped each trail information from WalkingKiwi
* Hurdles: Scraping takes *forever*

##### Sat May 8, 2021
* Tasks: Scrape and transform WalkingKiwi trail information. Clean.
* Accomplished: We have trail information for 3000 trails across NZ
* Hurdles: User reviews? hiking trail tags?

##### Sun May 9, 2021
* Tasks: Finish cleaning trail information. EDA.  Search for user reviews to scrape?
* Accomplished: EDA information to see if recommender engine can be generated from this info. Collected regional info for trails.
* Hurdles: Difficulties in user ratings attainable for the trails. Look into manual labour? Image collection?

##### Mon May 10, 2021
* Tasks: Trial out some form of content-based hike recommendations
* Accomplished: Woohoo! Learned Streamlit.io and already started deploying the recommendation model into the website!

##### Tues May 11, 2021
* Tasks: Implement filtering to search within dataframe to alter the recommendations
* Accomplished: filtering, started euclidean distance model and looked into altering cosine sim off name-only

##### Wed May 12, 2021
* Tasks: Finish recommendation from trail stats after any type of dataset filtering (location/stats). Get graph of elevation profile for hike in output
* Accomplished: Recommendations done. Elevation graph output done. Image spot set, need images for trails to fill each spot
* Hurdles: look into recommendation for other regions if search trail from different region

##### Thurs May 13, 2021
* Tasks: Add geographical information of trails and trailheads
* Accomplished: Early implementation of the map complete. 
* Hurdles: Need to add highlight and/or selectability of the trail from this widget. Search function.

##### Fri May 14, 2021
* Tasks: Update geo map. Work on trail specific map. Get elevation chart profile interactive.
* Accomplished: Main page map updated and filters with parameter filtering.
* Hurdles: Cannot get clickable interaction between map and search term text box. Path of trail map is increasingly difficult

##### Sat May 15, 2021
* Tasks: Work on recommended hike outputs
* Accomplished: Graph of location of the output hikes
* Hurdles: Cannot get coordinates of the hike to output on the map (recommended hikes)

##### Mon May 17, 2021
* Tasks: Work on presentation

##### Tues May 18, 2021
* Tasks: Deploy to AWS, work on presentation
* Accomplished: Everything :)
